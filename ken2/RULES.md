## **Gameplay Overview**
The game is played in turns. Players take turns performing the following steps:

### **Step 1: Place a Marker**
1. The player chooses one of their **rings**.
2. A marker (chip) of their color is placed inside the chosen ring and flipped to the player's color.

### **Step 2: Move the Ring**
- The player then moves the chosen ring in a straight line to another empty intersection.
- The ring can move over any number of empty intersections but **cannot jump over other rings**.

### **Flipping Markers**
- If a ring moves over one or more markers, **all the markers it jumps over get flipped** to the opposite color.
- The flipping happens only if the markers are in a straight line and continuous without any gaps.

### **Forming a Row of Five**
- If a player forms a row of five consecutive markers of their color (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally):
  1. The player **removes those five markers** from the board and put them back in the pool.
  2. The player then **removes one of their rings** from the board.
- The removed markers are not returned to the game.
- Removing a ring is the main objective; once a player removes **three rings**, they win the game.

## **Game End**
- The game ends when a player successfully removes three of their own rings from the board.
- That player is declared the **winner**.

## **Special Rules and Details**
- **Move Restrictions**: You cannot move a ring if it would land on another ring. The movement must end on an empty intersection.
- **Double Rows**: If creating a row of five simultaneously creates more rows, you must first complete the actions for the primary row before handling the additional rows.
- **Tie Handling**: If both players remove the third ring during the same turn, the game results in a **tie**.
