Diagonal.java - represents a diagonal that can take any direction from Direction.java enum and
simulate a walk along it (To DO : implement logic for the walk)
Direction.java - enum that contains 6 directions and it delta with respect to x&y
GameSimulation.java - main class for simulation, itteratively goes through each diagonal and
records all possible moves (check startSimulation)
Move.java - just a class to create objects with possible move (check getters) 

What i want to do: Nik
Detach game logic in a game engine class and GUI
the game logic checks move and returns t ot f then the gui knows whether we can place a ring
and then check the locations where coins need to be placed or flipped
Reason the bots can have access to the game state/ logic and act upon that
